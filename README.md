# living-room-lights-rpi
Manages the two ChSmartBulb I have in my living room

> Worst README.md ever ^.^ I know

I managed to get the lights I bought for my home working.
This is working perfectly 24/7.

The button1/button2/button3 is because I made a remote control for the lights with an M5 stack.

/button1: cycle intensity in intervals of 10% (starting with 10%)
/button2: start/stop color rotation
/button3: switch modes:

- same color
- opposite colors
- 33% difference in color wheel
- 50% difference in color wheel
- 20% difference in color wheel
- white
- violet
